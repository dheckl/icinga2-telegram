Icinga 2 Notifications to Telegram
==================================

The repository shows how to configure Icinga 2 to send notifications via
[Telegram](https://www.telegram.org).

These can be send either to:
* Group Chats
* Personal User Chat

Please note that **only** the transport is encrypted, but not the actual
messages. (They can be seen by Telegram employees).

Start by [creating a new bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots#create-a-new-bot).

When you first message the bot with `/start` or add it to a group, you can get
updates via the Telegram API, to get the Chat ID you want to sent messages to.

    curl --silent "https://api.telegram.org/bot${TOKEN}/getUpdates"

Use this chat ID to add it to a user.

Checkout the example files to configure Icinga 2:

* [telegram-service-notification.sh](telegram-service-notification.sh)
* [icinga2-example.conf](icinga2-example.conf)
